All reports, including final report can be found in the Documentation folder, along with various
documents we used during our implementation.
	Implementation Documents: Contains files describing the instruction set implemented, the
				design of the CPU and designs for tiles and levels of the game
	Presentations and Reports: Contains the lab report submitted describing register file and
				ALU integration, the slides from our mid-semester presentation and 
				our final report. 

The .bit file for our final implementation is located in the  Final Bit File folder.

Inside the Project Code folder is all of the code for the project, including our assembler:
	Assembler: 	Contains our assembler program type make from Linux command line to build then
			usage is: asmC16 <assembly code file to assemble> <output file> to assemble
			and coe <assembled code file> <output file> to convert file format to be that of 
			needed by the coregen to generate a block memory. All our assembly programs are 
			in the Programs subfolder.
	Modules:  	Contains all the verilog files needed to build the final version of the project
			organized in folders
	Test Benches:	Contains all test benches
	Test Modules:	Contains the Fibonacci test module that was built to test the ALU's integration
			with the register file.
